## Starting the Application

To run the **Team Information Assistant** application a user will need to pull the github repository from the link found below:

Next, the user will need to open their terminal to the base directory and run an npm i command to install the modules necessary to run this application.

Following this, the user will be able to start the application using the terminal command node index.js which will begin the data collection process. The user will then be able to fill in each of the prompts according to their specification, and will have options in the 'main menu' to add an additional enginner or intern to the team.

Once the user has created all of their necessary team members, they can select the 'Finish Building My Team' selection from the 'main menu' which will trigger the necessary function to generate the index.html file. 

Finally, a user can navigate to that file and open it in their browser to view the team they created.
